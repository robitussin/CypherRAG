These \\nwould be acquired through an educational process guided by the philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.  \\nThis philosophy has as its guiding tenets, the internalizing all that is good in the Filipino people: warmth, \\nhospitality, innovativeness, and a high emotional quotient that has made Filipinos renowned in service \\noriented industries.”  \\nThis young man, Don Mariano Fortunato Jhocson, guided by this vision, founded Colegio Filipino, now \\nNATIONAL UNIVERSITY on August 01, 1900, in Quiapo, City of Manila. It was the first non – sectarian and \\nco – educational institution then. There were only a handful of students at that time in the fledgling \\nSchool, and they were in the elementary and secondary (High School) lev els.

The \\ngrowth of the Academy was continuous, and added Liberal Arts which became the gateway to other \\ndisciplines that followed.  \\nAfter 21 years of educational service, on January 17, 1921, the Board of Trustees applied for and secured \\npermission from the Department of Public Instruction to change the name of the National Academy to \\nNATIONAL UNIVERSITY. On that same day, the University also installed Senator Camilo Osias, one of the \\nmost respected and outstanding Filipino educators as President of the University.  \\nThereafter, the Colleges of Education and Commerce were opened in the same year.

This chapter states the policy on discipline, faculty conduct and behavior, \\ngrievance procedure and the schedule of offenses and the corresponding sanctions.  \\n \\nSECTION 1:  POLICY STATEMENT  \\nIt is the sincere desire of National University to help its faculty in every way possible so that both will \\nsucceed in their respective endeavors, but willful or inexcusable breach of the Code will be dealt with \\nfirmly under a uniform policy such that the provisions of this Code shall apply to all faculty regardless of \\nstatus, rank,  or position.  \\nNational University views disciplinary action more of a correction or preventive measure than a punitive \\none.  National University, in adopting and promulgating these rules and regulations, intend to abort the \\nmisconduct and offenses caused by a minority, if not isolated few, of the faculty. National University does \\nnot in any way want that the great majority of the employees who are performing efficiently and loyally \\nand who make National University a respected organization to feel that the adoption of the se policies is \\nan adverse reflection on them.  \\n \\nSECTION 2:  ETHICAL CONDUCT  \\n2.1 In order to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, employees are expected to abide by ethical \\nstandards.  \\n \\n2.2 Employees  should not solicit anything of value from any person or organization with whom the \\nNational University has a current or potential business relationship.  \\n \\n2.3 Employees should not accept any item of value from any party in exchange for or in connection with \\na business transaction between National University and that other party.  \\n \\n2.4 Employees may accept items of incidental value from customers, suppliers, or others if the gift is \\nnot given in response to solicitation of favor and long as it implies no exchange for business any \\npurpose. Items may include gifts, gratuities, food, drink,  and entertainment.  \\n \\n2.5 If faced with and unsure how to handle a situation that may potentially violate this code of ethical \\nconduct, notify the immediate supervisor .

OBJECTIVES  \\nThis policy has the following objectives:  \\nA. Evaluate faculty performance based on the faculty’s teaching, research, and community \\nengagement responsibilities.  \\nB. Motivate the faculty to perform to their full potential.  \\nC. Provide the basis for annual merit, renewal of term appointment, appointment to \\nprobationary or permanent status, promotion in rank, and faculty development.  \\n \\nII. SCOPE  \\nThe SPES for Faculty comprises Teaching Effectiveness, Research and Innovation, Community \\nEngagement, and Professional Development.  It applies to all faculty members with term and \\nregular appointments, part -time (PT) and full -time (FT).  For SPES purposes , adjunct faculty will \\nbe evaluated similarly to part -time faculty. The use of the term “college” in this document refers \\nto the colleges in NU Main and the schools in NU campuses.  \\n \\nIII. GENERAL GUIDELINES  \\nA. Each component of the SPES has an allocated maximum point.  Any point in excess from \\neach component is not transferable to other components.  Similarly, each sub -component \\nhas a maximum point allocation, and any point in excess is not transferable to other  sub-\\ncomponents.  \\nB. The minimum SPES rating of a faculty must be equal to or better than the institutional Key \\nPerformance Indicator (KPI) for the Faculty SPES rating for the academic year.  SPES rating \\nfalling below the KPI may be a ground for non -renewal of contract in the case of part -time, \\ncontractual full -time, and probationary full -time faculty or further performance review for \\nregular faculty.   \\nC. For faculty with term appointments, the Teaching Effectiveness rating, particularly the \\nOnline Teachers Evaluation (OTE), maybe a basis for the non -renewal of the contract in the \\nsucceeding term.  \\nD. Details of the activities, accomplishments, engagements, etc., must be listed per component.  \\nSupporting documents must be available for verification upon request.  \\nE. Only activities or undertakings accomplished within the evaluation period must be reflected \\nin the SPES unless indicated.  Any activity or accomplishment should only be reflected or \\ncredited in one component.  \\nF. Submission of the College SPES Summary to the Human Resource Office (HRO) is as follows:  \\n• 15 days after the end of the term for PT faculty  \\n• 30 days after the end of the Academic Year (AY) for FT faculty  \\n \\n \\n ', 'Title:  \\nEMPLOYEE MANUAL  Reference No.  OPR – HRD – D – M – 001 (01) \\nDEPARTMENT  HUMAN RESOURCES  \\nThis is a controlled document.

FREQUENCY  \\nA. The SPES for full -time faculty, whether probationary, contractual, or regular, will be required \\nonce at the end of every academic year.   \\nB. The SPES for part -time faculty will be required at the end of every term.  \\n \\nV. RATING REFERENCE  \\nA. The rating reference for the Faculty SPES is consistent with the instruments used by the \\nUniversity in evaluating the performance of its personnel.  \\nB. Unless otherwise reflected in the Institutional Quality Objectives, a faculty must receive a \\ndescriptive rating of at least “Meets Expectation.”    \\nC. The rating reference is as shown below:  \\n \\nRange  Description  From  To \\n6.51  7.00  Truly Exceptional  \\n6.00  6.50  Excellent  \\n5.00  5.99  Exceeds Expectations  \\n4.00  4.99  Meets Expectation  \\n3.00  3.99  Fairly Satisfactory  \\n2.00  2.99  Unsatisfactory  \\n1.00  1.99  Very Unsatisfactory  \\n \\nVI. SPES COMPONENTS  \\nThe SPES is composed of four (4) areas upon which the performance of the faculty will be \\nevaluated:  \\n• Teaching Effectiveness  \\n• Research and Innovation  \\n• Community Engagement  \\n• Professional Development  \\nAll full -time faculty will be evaluated on the four (4) components.  The part -time faculty \\nconsidering the nature of their engagement with the University, will only be assessed on \\nTeaching Effectiveness.  \\nA. Weight Distribution  \\nThe weight distribution of each SPES component is as shown below per campus type.   \\n \\n \\n \\n ', 'Title:  \\nEMPLOYEE MANUAL  Reference No.  OPR – HRD – D – M – 001 (01) \\nDEPARTMENT  HUMAN RESOURCES  \\nThis is a controlled document.
