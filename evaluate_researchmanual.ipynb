Equally relevant in \\nthis context is the utilization of such knowledge and of innovative ideas consequently proceeding from it for \\nthe development of beneficial tangible and non -tangible outputs to nation building.   National Univer sity also \\nrecognizes the collective synergy through  collaboration with the Main campus, other separate NU campuses  \\n(collectively called NU Philippines or NU Phil) , and other academic institutions in consortium agreements with \\nNU. \\n \\nResearch in National University supports the ARC (Academic Research Community Engagement) framework of \\nthe University that closely integrates, whenever  and where ever  possible,  the Academic, Research and \\nCommunity Engagement endeavors into one significant whole.  \\n \\nThe University has established university -wide research centers to focus on specific goals with the intent of \\nproviding a formal forum for multi  and trans -disciplinary strategies and activities within the National University \\ncommunit y. These centers include:  \\n• Center for Research  \\n• Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship  \\n• Center for Resilient Philippines  \\n \\nThe approved research budget is appropriately allocated among the colleges based on the number of full -time \\nfaculty member s. \\n \\nThe Colleges and  Campuses may also submit proposals for the formation of C ollege -based research and \\ninnovation centers based on the core competencies of the College/Campus,  but can be tapped to cater to the \\nneeds of the University  constituency . \\n \\nA. CENTER FOR RESEARCH  \\n \\nAs National U endeavors to become a leading institution in advancing concepts and paradigms \\napplicable to research and responsive to the development of national and global needs, it sets up a Center for \\nResearch to serve as its research arm in do ing the following:  \\n \\n1. Establishing NU as a center of excellence in research.  \\n2. Supporting the further development of a research culture.  \\n3. Broadening the development of the research capacity of NU across all disciplines and extending the \\nresearch -based knowledge  to the national and international communit ies. \\n4.

The faculty member is \\nexpected to do research primarily in aid of instruction  (i.e., her/his instruction is research based and/or \\nenriched by research ), community  / industry  engagement , IP generation  or for start -up. The research outputs \\nshould not be limited to the following: action research or participatory action research, policy and \\nproject/program review and evaluation which are regional in scope); treatise; a nd empirical/experimental \\nresearch. Each output is awarded a raise in a professional rank according to the criteria set by the present \\nresearch manual.  \\n \\nFor paper presentations, a higher requirement (e.g. Scopus or ISI Indexed  Publications ) can satisfy a \\nlower requirement (e.g. Paper Presentation , completed IFRPP ), but any number of the lower requirement (e.g. \\nPaper Presentation, completed IFRPP ) cannot replace a higher requirement.   For IP generation, a higher \\nrequirement (e.g. patent ) can satisfy a lower  requirement (e.g. utility model ), but any number of the lower \\nrequirement (e.g. industrial design or trade secret ) cannot replace a higher requirement . \\n \\n  ', ' \\nTitle:  \\nRESEARCH  \\n MANUAL  Reference No.  RAD – RS – D – M – 001  \\nDEPARTMENT  OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT  \\nCopies To  All Concerned Units  \\nThis is a controlled document.

TYPES OF RESEARCH  \\n \\nResearch in NU is focused on three major types: fundamental research, applied research, and \\nexperimental development.  \\n \\n1. Fundamental research refers to pure basic research or to strategic basic research. Pure basic research \\nis experimental and theoretical work undertaken to acquire new knowledge without looking for long -\\nterm benefits other than the advancement of knowledge. Strategic basic research is experimental and \\ntheoretical work undertaken to acquire new knowledge directed to specified broad areas in the \\nexpectation of useful disco veries. It provides the broad base of knowledge necessary for the solution \\nof recognized practical problems.  \\n \\n2. Applied research is original work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge with a specific \\napplication in view. It is undertaken either to de termine possible use for the findings of basic research \\nor to determine new ways of achieving some specific and predetermined objectives.  \\n \\n3. Experimental development is systematic work, using existing knowledge gained from research or \\npractical experience th at is directed to producing new materials, products, or devices; to installing \\nnew processes, systems, and services; or to substantial improvement of already produced or installed \\nsystems.  \\n \\nOverall, NU shall invest and give equal emphasis to all the above types of research in terms of resources \\nand time allocation. Nonetheless, NU also provides resources for creative works  and other forms of IP.   \\n \\n \\nB. COMMISSIONED RESEARCH PROJECT  (Comm RP)   \\n \\nComm RP refers to a project , which has been recommended or initiated by the Office of the National \\nUniversity  President  or the President’s Council . The President can directly assign or commission an \\nacademic teaching faculty, an academic service faculty, or a support staff to do a CommRP. Research \\nproposals for Comm RP should fall under the research priority areas of NU.   \\n \\nCommRP will follow the forms of IFRPPs .  All standard protocols  for IFRPPs will be applied, except for the \\nusual endorsements from CRC, PC and Dean, and the process of deliberation.   Endorsement and approval \\nwill be solely undertaken by the NU President. Once approved by the NU Presid ent, the concerned NU \\nunits (the CRC, PC and Dean for faculty member propo nents) will be provided a copy of the approved \\nCommRP propos al. \\n \\n ', ' \\nTitle:  \\nRESEARCH  \\n MANUAL  Reference No.  RAD – RS – D – M – 001  \\nDEPARTMENT  OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT  \\nCopies To  All Concerned Units  \\nThis is a controlled document.

SPECIAL LY FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECT  (SFRP )   \\n \\nSFRP  refers to any of the following :  \\n1. A product of a formal agreement between National U and government or non -government \\ninstitutions.  \\n2. A fast -track project meant to be undertaken as soon as possible to give solution to an urgent \\nproblem.  \\n \\nResearch proposals for SFRP  should fall on research p riority areas agreed by the aforementioned \\ninstitutions ; or addresses an obvious emergency situation.  \\n \\nResearch proposals for SFRP  must follow the following guidelines in carrying it out.  \\n \\n1. Members of the NU faculty and ASP who are interested to apply for SFRP  should look for co -\\nresearchers from partner institutions preferably from the consortium institution s.  For fast -track \\nprojects, researchers can partner with internal and external proponents to ensure t hat t he needed \\nexpertise are met.  \\n2. Members of the NU faculty and ASP with identified co -researchers can apply for SFRP  by expressing \\ntheir intention in writing to the Center for Research Director.  \\n3. The research proposal for internally funded SFRP  shall be reviewed for its fo rm and substance by two \\nevaluators: one from NU and one from the partner institution/s  or any identified expert ; and for its \\nethical value by the University Ethics Review Committee.  \\n4. The researchers of internally funded SFRP  shall follow the existing guidelines set by their respective \\ninstitutions.  \\n5. The research proposal for externally funded SFRP  shall no longer be subjected for review by the \\nevaluation committee of the partner institutions. The proponents shall follow the gu idelines set by the \\nfunding agency  if EFRP; and must conform with NU guidel ines if IFRP.  \\n \\n \\nD. INTERNALLY FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECT  (IFRP)    \\n \\n Internally  funded research  project  propo sals should be based on the Research Agenda  of NU  and its \\ncolleges .  Ideally, a proponent is allocated with seed fund to jump -start a research interest and develop \\nresearch capability aligned with the applicant’s long -term development plan . NU aims to facilitate and \\nfoster research and has created a set of guidelines to achieve this goal with respect to  funding  packages. \\nMulti -disciplinary collaborative proposal s are highly encouraged. The proposal must be reviewed  and \\nendorsed by the  Program Chair  or Immediate Supervisor , CRC (College/Campus Res earch Coordinator)  \\nand t he Dean of the College  or Academic Director  where the proponent/s belong.  \\n \\nIt is a requirement that the output of the  IFRP  must be published or qualify with the criteria for IP filing.  \\nIt is ideal  that the internal  funding results in research proposals submitted to outside research funding \\nagencies and, ultimately, successful external funding of the faculty members ’ research  activities. Research \\nfunding may come from a number of internal budget centers including the Center for Research .

POLICY ON ETHICS  \\n \\na. Humans and human communities as research subjects  \\n \\na. The interests and rights of those involved or affected by the research must be appropriately \\nsafeguarded. The principle of voluntary participation and withdrawal of participation at any time \\nby the participants must be respected.  \\n \\nb. The researchers must ensure that the legislative requirements on human rights and \\nconfidentiality or anonymity of participants have been met. Clearly, anonymity is a stronger \\nguarantee of privacy, but if the re searchers must know the names of participants, this or any \\ninformation that could serve to identify the participants cannot be released to the public. The \\nresearchers must explain in writing how the participants’ right to privacy will be safeguarded.  \\n \\nc. The researchers must secure informed consent before the work begins and must not expose the \\nparticipants to risk of harm as a consequence of that participation. Harm includes both physical \\nand psychological offenses against the sensibilities of the participant s. Researchers must also \\nensure that the research participants must are informed about the procedures and possible risks \\nbefore they sign the consent form. Signed consent forms must be presented on demand. In the \\ncase of children, the parent or guardian ca n give the informed consent.  \\n \\nd. The researchers must maintain integrity and develop the highest possible standards of research \\npractices including research design, data collection, storage, analysis, interpretation and \\nreporting.

Researchers should observe research integrity at all times whatever type of research activity \\nthey are engaged in (e.g., data gathering and analysis, application for funding and grants, \\npublication).  \\n \\nb. Researchers should acknowledge and/or include colleagu es who have directly and indirectly \\ncontributed to the work.  \\n \\nc. All researchers should actively practice the following:  \\n \\ni. Emphasizing high quality research;  \\nii. undertaking appropriate research supervision;  \\niii. maintaining accurate and detailed research activity records and results;  \\niv. being ethical about the objectives of one’s research;  \\nv. being open to and cooperative with one’s fellow researchers and others;  \\nvi. being committed in publishing and further developing or commercializing one’s \\nresearch findings.  \\n \\nd. Researchers are accountable to society, their respective professions, communities and \\nuniversities where the research is taking place, the staff and students involved, and to sponsors \\nfunding the research.  \\n \\ne. At the beginning of a research project, researchers are required to declare in writing and \\nmanage potential conflicts of interest. At the end of a research project, researchers are required \\nto disclose any real financial or professional conflict of interest in writing. Areas of real or \\npotential  conflict of interests include the following:  \\n \\ni. researchers having an existing or potential financial interest in the outcome of the \\nresearch;  \\n \\nii. researchers likely gaining any private benefit that is dependent on the research \\noutcome; and  \\n \\niii. researcher’s profe ssional or personal gain arising from the research outcome may be \\nmore than usual or normal in a specific research undertaking.  \\n ', ' \\nTitle:  \\nRESEARCH  \\n MANUAL  Reference No.  RAD – RS – D – M – 001  \\nDEPARTMENT  OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT  \\nCopies To  All Concerned Units  \\nThis is a controlled document.

RESEARCH MISCONDUCT  \\n \\nThe following violate commonly accepted principles and practices of research upheld by the general \\nacademic community. Such are serious offenses that NU considers as research misconduct that call for \\nstrict disciplinary action.  \\n \\n1. Fabrication of data : Dishonesty in reporting results ranging from fabrication of data, improper \\nadjustment of results,  and gross negligence in collecting or analyzing data, to selective reporting or \\nomission of data for deceptive purposes;  \\n \\n2. Falsification of research : Deliberately misrepresenting research, including the progress of research, \\nmaking grossly exaggerated clai ms of the significance of research results, falsely claiming priority by \\nwillfully ignoring prior relevant reports in research literature;  \\n \\n3. Plagiarism : Taking credit for someone else’s work and ideas, stealing other’s results or methods, \\nomitting acknowled gment of significant contributions received from others, copying the writing of \\nothers without proper acknowledgment, or falsely taking credit for the work and ideas of others;  \\n \\n4. Failure to acknowledge : Willfully ignoring and failing to acknowledge the sour ce of materials used in \\nlaboratory research or significant human assistance.  \\n \\n5. Abuse of confidentiality : Taking or releasing ideas and data that were shared with the legitimate \\nexpectation of confidentiality (e.g. use of confidential results without permiss ion of other researchers \\nor previous employers), stealing ideas from others’ grant proposals, award applications, or manuscript \\npublication;  \\n \\n6. Dishonesty in publication : Knowingly publishing material that will mislead readers (e. g. \\nmisrepresenting data, pa rticularly its originality, misrepresenting research progress, adding the names \\nof other authors without their permission, or including honorary authorships or excluding a major \\ncollaborator as co -author of the paper);  \\n \\n7. Misuse of funds : Failure to spend re search funds in ways consistent with the goals stated in the \\nrelevant contract documents and/or failure to maintain clear and proper records of expenditures;  \\n \\n8. Mistreatment of human research subjects : Individuals and communities have the right to know the \\nresults of research in which they have been involved as subjects even if they do not exercise that right: \\nResearchers must supply a form of report to individuals or the community that was the subject of \\nresearch. Researchers then mistreat their researc h subjects if they fail to obtain from them their \\ninformed consent and to protect their rights as informants regarding their privacy, anonymity, and \\nconfidentiality of information sources.  \\n ', ' \\nTitle:  \\nRESEARCH  \\n MANUAL  Reference No.  RAD – RS – D – M – 001  \\nDEPARTMENT  OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT  \\nCopies To  All Concerned Units  \\nThis is a controlled document.

Failure to report known incidents of serious research misconduct : Covering up or otherwise failing to \\nreport major offenses of research known to oneself; and/or  \\n \\n10. Retaliation against informants : Taking punitive action against an individual for having reported \\nalleged major research offenses.  \\n \\n11. Supervision : For a group research project, leaders are responsible for the supervision of the whole \\nresearch process, including the designing of the research project; preparing funding applications, the \\ndesign of experimental or research protocols; analyzing and recording of data;  and the publishing and \\ndisseminating of results. The project leader is also responsible for the appointment of suitably qualified \\nresearch assistants and for the supervision of the research assistants in the course of the research.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ', ' \\nTitle:  \\nRESEARCH  \\n MANUAL  Reference No.  RAD – RS – D – M – 001  \\nDEPARTMENT  OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT  FOR \\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOP MENT  \\nCopies To  All Concerned Units  \\nThis is a controlled document.

It provides general \\ninformation governing the monitoring  of National U niversity Research agenda and contracts , and is neither an \\nexpression or an implied contract. Moreover, it is not a substitute for sound management judgment and \\ndiscretion.  \\n \\nIt is obviously not possible to anticipate every situation that may arise in the campus or to provide \\ninformation that answers all issues. Thus,  circumstance s will undoubtedly require that pol icies and regulations, \\npractices and guidelines described in this Manual change from time to time. Accordingly, National University \\nreserves the right to modify, supplement, remove or revise any provision in this Manual as it deems necessary \\nor appropriate  in its sole discretion with or without notice.  \\n \\nIf any statement in this Manual is not clear, please check with your immediate superior for clarification.  \\nShould you find some items in this Manual that you believe can be improved for the better delivery and \\nunderstanding of every employee in National University, we welcome your comments and suggestions.  \\n \\nThis Manual supersedes any and all prior policies, procedures, and manuals of National University as \\nstated in the Manual Control Version Log.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          The Office of the Vice President  for  \\nResearch and Development  \\n            National University  \\n \\n ',\n",

Equally relevant in \\nthis context is the utilization of such knowledge and of innovative ideas consequently proceeding from it for \\nthe development of beneficial tangible and non -tangible outputs to nation building.   National Univer sity also \\nrecognizes the collective synergy through  collaboration with the Main campus, other separate NU campuses  \\n(collectively called NU Philippines or NU Phil) , and other academic institutions in consortium agreements with \\nNU. \\n \\nResearch in National University supports the ARC (Academic Research Community Engagement) framework of \\nthe University that closely integrates, whenever  and where ever  possible,  the Academic, Research and \\nCommunity Engagement endeavors into one significant whole.  \\n \\nThe University has established university -wide research centers to focus on specific goals with the intent of \\nproviding a formal forum for multi  and trans -disciplinary strategies and activities within the National University \\ncommunit y. These centers include:  \\n• Center for Research  \\n• Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship  \\n• Center for Resilient Philippines  \\n \\nThe approved research budget is appropriately allocated among the colleges based on the number of full -time \\nfaculty member s. \\n \\nThe Colleges and  Campuses may also submit proposals for the formation of C ollege -based research and \\ninnovation centers based on the core competencies of the College/Campus,  but can be tapped to cater to the \\nneeds of the University  constituency . \\n \\n \\nAs National U endeavors to become a leading institution in advancing concepts and paradigms \\napplicable to research and responsive to the development of national and global needs, it sets up a Center for \\nResearch to serve as its research arm in do ing the following:  \\n \\n1. Establishing NU as a center of excellence in research.  \\n2. Supporting the further development of a research culture.  \\n3. Broadening the development of the research capacity of NU across all disciplines and extending the \\nresearch -based knowledge  to the national and international communit ies. \\n4. Encouraging and empowering faculty members to manage, conduct, disseminate, and report research \\nresults.  ']"
