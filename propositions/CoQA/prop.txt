For Heather Neroy, the process of saving interesting arts-and-crafts projects or recipes from the Internet used to be tedious.
Whenever Heather Neroy came across an interesting arts-and-crafts project or recipe on the Internet, she would save it for later by copying the link.
Heather Neroy would paste the link into an e-mail and send it to herself.
After that, Heather Neroy would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference.
The system that Heather Neroy used was not exactly the most efficient.
Last year, during one of her browsing sessions, Heather Neroy read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest.
Pinterest is a virtual pinboard where users can pin and organize images onto individual boards.
Pinterest did not pique Heather Neroy's interest at first.
Heather Neroy quickly changed her mind about Pinterest.
Someone described Pinterest as an online filing system.
Heather Neroy thought, 'That's exactly what I need' after hearing the description of Pinterest.
Soon, Heather Neroy was pinning away on Pinterest.
Like many Pinterest users, Heather Neroy got quickly hooked on the platform.
Heather Neroy first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas.
Next, Heather Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom.
Heather Neroy and her husband could add to the shared color board.
Pinterest allows other users to follow each other's boards.
Pinterest allows users to 're-pin' another person's images.
In no time, Heather Neroy was sharing other people's pins.
Heather Neroy was following users with similar tastes.
Heather Neroy found it neat to see what other moms are pinning.
Some days, Heather Neroy runs out of ideas and does not know what to do to fill the time before bedtime.
Heather Neroy thought Pinterest was going to be just her organizing.
Pinterest is really a community sharing all these different ideas that Heather Neroy did not even know existed.

The particular circle of society in which Ben and Johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the news.

Early that morning, the most exciting topic of conversation had been Tim Dooley's perfidy.
The news spread that Ben and Johnny were no longer proud of their neat little bit of real estate.
The change made by Ben and Johnny would probably be the means of their financial ruin.
Ben and Johnny had been extravagant by engaging rooms at a regular boarding-house.
Ben and Johnny were to spend their substance on three square meals each day.
The price which Ben and Johnny were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week.
Jimmy Sullivan stated that Johnny himself had told him that Ben and Johnny were to start a regular theatre.
Several others supported Jimmy Sullivan's statement as the time wore on.
Ben and Johnny had already engaged a hall for the theatre.
The hall would be converted into a first-class place of amusement as soon as possible.
The rumor about Ben and Johnny starting a theatre would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring their credit.
The rumor must therefore be true because it came so directly from one of the parties concerned.

Puberty occurs through a long process.
Puberty begins with a surge in hormone production.
The surge in hormone production causes a number of physical changes.
Puberty is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics.
Secondary sex characteristics in boys include a deeper voice and larger adam's apple.
Secondary sex characteristics in girls include the development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips.
Puberty involves a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state.
The pituitary gland triggers puberty.
The pituitary gland secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream.
The surge of hormonal agents initiates a chain reaction.
The male and female gonads are subsequently activated during puberty.
The activation of the gonads puts them into a state of rapid growth and development.
The triggered gonads commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals.
The testes primarily release testosterone.
The ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen.
The production of testosterone and estrogen increases gradually until sexual maturation is met.
Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones.
Gynecomastia may also occur due to tissue responsiveness or obesity.

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in 'The Proposal.'
The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other until they realize they love each other is proudly square.
The story follows the tradition of romantic comedies from the 1940s and 1950s.

Height above average terrain (HAAT) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape.
HAAT is also known as Effective Height Above Average Terrain (EHAAT).
HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television.
HAAT is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts.
VHF and UHF are line of sight transmissions.
For international coordination, HAAT is officially measured in meters.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States measures HAAT in meters.
Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries.
Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly.
The reduction of power is based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover.
The List of North American broadcast station classes provides more information on station classes.
The FCC procedure to calculate HAAT involves drawing either 12 or 16 radials from the proposed or actual antenna site.
Points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial are used in the calculation.
The entire radial graph can be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station.
The altitude of the antenna site is subtracted by the average altitude of all the specified points to calculate HAAT.
This calculation can create unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions.
It is possible to have a negative number for HAAT.
A negative HAAT indicates that the transmitter is located in a valley with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself.

Endemism is the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location.
A defined geographic location can be an island, nation, country, or other defined zone, or habitat type.
Organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere.
The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution.
An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive.
The term precinctive applies to species and subspecific categories that are restricted to a defined geographical area.
The word 'endemic' is from New Latin 'endēmicus'.
The word 'endemic' is derived from Greek 'ενδήμος', which means 'native'.
'Endēmos' is formed of 'en' meaning 'in', and 'dēmos' meaning 'the people'.
The term 'precinctive' has been suggested by some scientists.
The term 'precinctive' was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917.
The term 'precinctive' is the equivalent of 'endemism'.
'Precinction' was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy.
'Precinctive' seems to have been coined by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900.
David Sharp used the word 'precinctive' in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion'.
'Precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified.
The definition of 'precinctive' excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks.
Physical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism.
The orange-breasted sunbird is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa.
The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska.
Political factors can play a part if a species is protected in one jurisdiction but not another.
Political factors can play a part if a species is actively hunted in one jurisdiction but not another.

Writing articles about films for The Front Page was the first proper job of the author.
Before writing for The Front Page, the author had done bits of reviewing.

Tom Seaton had also written for television.
Tom Seaton hired the author.
Tom Seaton was not primarily a journalist.

Tom Seaton's idea was that a team of critics should take care of art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge.

There would be a weekly lunch at which the team would make choices from the artistic material.

If a person were a pilot flying a plane, and suddenly the engine failed, the person would have to make a choice to eject or stay in the plane.
The choice for a pilot is very difficult.
If a pilot ejects, the pilot is wise, but the plane crashes.
If a pilot stays in the plane, the pilot risks his life.
Recently, Li Feng was a Chinese Air Force pilot who faced the choice of whether to eject or stay in the plane during a training exercise.
Li Feng is 38 years old.
The incident occurred on March 7.
Li Feng was flying a Jian-10 (Fighter-10) at an altitude of 4,500 meters.
A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen.
Li Feng realized the plane might fail at any moment.
Li Feng did a quick check of the engine.
Li Feng asked the base if he could return.
When the fighter was 7 km away from the airport, the engine stopped working.
The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters.
Under Air Force rules, fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted.
Before Li Feng lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject.
Li Feng insisted on having another try.
Li Feng knew where the deadline to abandon the aircraft was.
Li Feng was prepared for the ejection.
Li Feng decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control.
After 104 seconds, Li Feng was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing.
The plane only suffered slight damage.
Li's teacher, Xu Yongling, wrote in a text message to Li Feng after the landing, 'You are a hero! Congratulations!'
Xu Yongling said Li Feng was a cool-headed pilot and very professional.
Li Feng's brave and calm act saved the 200 million yuan aircraft.
Li Feng's act also gave him invaluable first-hand experience of dealing with an engine emergency.
For his outstanding performance, the Air Force recently awarded Li Feng a gold medal.

The phrase 'If I rest, I _' would be an excellent motto for those who are troubled by the slightest bit of idleness.
Even the most hard-working person might adopt the motto with advantage.
The motto serves as a reminder that if a person allows his abilities to rest, they will soon show signs of rust.
The iron in the unused key serves as an analogy for abilities that are not used.
Eventually, abilities that rest cannot do the work required of them.
Those who would attain the heights reached and kept by great men must keep their ability polished by constant use.
Keeping abilities polished allows individuals to unlock the doors of knowledge.
The doors of knowledge guard the entrances to the professions.
The doors of knowledge guard the entrances to science.
The doors of knowledge guard the entrances to art.
The doors of knowledge guard the entrances to literature.
The doors of knowledge guard the entrances to agriculture.
The doors of knowledge guard every department of human endeavor.
Industry keeps the key bright that opens the treasury of achievement.

Edmund Stone would never have found the key to the science of mathematics if he had given his spare moments to idleness.
Ferguson was a little Scotch lad.
If Ferguson had allowed his busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside, he would never have become a famous astronomer.
Ferguson calculated the position of the stars by a string of beads.
Labor defeats all.
Labor is not inconstant or ill-directed labor.
Labor is faithful, persistent, daily effort toward a well-directed purpose.
Industry is the price of noble and enduring success.

Caleb had fury in his heart.
Caleb had but one desire: to kill his successful rival, Marcus.
Marcus had escaped and returned to Rome.
There could be no doubt that Marcus had returned to Rome.
Marcus was one of the wealthiest of the patricians in Rome.
Marcus had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring.
Marcus's newly acquired property had been taken to the house where Marcus awaited the Pearl-Maiden.
This was the end of the long rivalry between Caleb and Marcus.
Caleb had fought, toiled, schemed, and suffered for this rivalry.
Caleb would have preferred to see the Pearl-Maiden cast to the foul Domitian rather than be with Marcus.
Caleb believed that the Pearl-Maiden would have hated Domitian.
Caleb knew that the Pearl-Maiden loved Marcus.
Now there remained nothing but revenge for Caleb.

Kleinfeld is a fancy store featured on the television program Say Yes to the Dress.
As the trip approached, the narrator asked Marina if she was excited.
Marina responded with 'Sure, Mom.'

Parents might tell older children to 'Act your age'.
Some researchers say that persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are acting their age.
Teenagers can look all grown up.
Studies have shown that the brains of teenagers are still developing.
The extent to which brain development explains teenage behavior is a subject of debate.
Jay Giedd is a leader in research on brain development at America's National Institutes of Health.
Doctor Jay Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991.
The group of young people visits Doctor Jay Giedd every two years for imaging tests of their brains.
Doctor Jay Giedd says considerable brain development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties.
A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers.
Researchers believe that the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex controls judgment and consideration of risk.
The underdevelopment of the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast.
Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia.
Professor Laurence Steinberg says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves.
Stronger laws and stronger parental control include raising the age for driving.
Professor Laurence Steinberg says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior.
Other researchers say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for the findings about teenage brain development.
Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego.
Mr. Robert Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture.
Mr. Robert Epstein says that behavior depends for the most part on socialization.
Mr. Robert Epstein believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults and are treated more like adults.
Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco.
Mr. Mike Males suggests that the discussion about brainless teens could be an attempt to divert attention from the reality.
Mr. Mike Males writes in the New York Times that it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened.
Mr. Mike Males questions why grown-ups do not act as if they have superior brains if that is the case.
Five minutes after Paula had left Dick, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car.
Dick was accompanied by Thayer, the Idaho buyer.
Dick was also accompanied by Naismith, the special correspondent for the Breeders' Gazette.
Wardman, the sheep manager, joined Dick, Thayer, and Naismith at the corrals.
Several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection at the corrals.
There was little need for conversation among Dick, Thayer, and Naismith.
Thayer was distinctly disappointed by the lack of conversation.
Thayer felt that the purchase of ten carloads of expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation.
Dick assured Thayer that the rams speak for themselves.
Dick turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest.
Ten minutes later, Dick advised Thayer not to bother to select the rams.
Dick told Thayer that the average quality of the rams was all top.
Dick stated that Thayer could spend a week picking his ten carloads and have no higher grade than if he had taken the first to hand.
Thayer was perturbed by Dick's cool assumption that the sale was already consummated.
Thayer had the sure knowledge that he had never seen such high quality of rams.
Thayer was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads.
Thayer told Naismith that it was his first visit to Forrest's.
Thayer described Forrest as a wizard.
Thayer had been buying sheep in the East and importing them.
Thayer stated that the Shropshires won his judgment.
Thayer noted that he doubled his order for the rams.
Thayer believed that Idaho buyers would be wild for the Shropshires.
Thayer only had buying orders straight for six carloads.
Thayer had contingent buying orders for two carloads more based on his judgment.
Thayer expressed that if every buyer does not double his order when he sees the rams, he does not know sheep.
Thayer believed that the rams were the goods.
Thayer stated that if the rams do not increase the sheep game of Idaho, then Forrest is no breeder and Thayer is no buyer.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Sherlock Holmes is the most popular role in the movies.
Robert Downey Jr. hardly seems like the iconic Sherlock Holmes.
Robert Downey Jr. is too short and muscular.
Robert Downey Jr. strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes easily to the English.
Robert Downey Jr. can take his place alongside such oddball castings as Buster Keaton, Charlton Heston, and George C. Scott.
Robert Downey Jr. is ideally suited to the purpose of director Guy Ritchie.
Guy Ritchie's purpose is not to dust off the grandfather's Conan Doyle.
Guy Ritchie's purpose is to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth.
The equation works both ways in these movies.
This version of Sherlock Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors.
This version of Sherlock Holmes is even a bit of a boor.
This version of Sherlock Holmes is still a more cerebral action hero than is found in most blockbusters.
The period trappings help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations.
The period trappings include a seamless blend of CGI and location work.
Guy Ritchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney map out a fast-moving Victorian adventure.
The Victorian adventure is ridiculously digressive.
The Victorian adventure crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony.
Just down the road from 221 Baker Street, workers are digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground.
The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles.
A series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers.
Sherlock Holmes detects something other than social unrest behind the bombings.
Sherlock Holmes detects an evil master plan leading inexorably to his nemesis.
Sherlock Holmes's nemesis is Professor Moriarty.

It was one thing to have Roger missing.
It was quite another to have Dave's chum gone.
The berth was made up as if it had never been occupied.
Dave muttered to himself, 'He went to bed--I saw him go.'

Dave stepped to one of the corners of the passageway.
Dave walked to the main saloon.
The main saloon had big sofas and easy-chairs.
The main saloon had a grand piano.
Not a soul was in sight anywhere in the main saloon.
Dave murmured, 'Well, if this isn't the queerest yet.'
Dave pinched himself to make certain that he was not dreaming.

Meggy Rattray was a simple woman.
Meggy Rattray could have deceived individuals into believing that she did not notice who put the three-penny-bit in the plate.
A few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime.
Most of the unaware men were farmers with their eyes on the windows.
All the women at the meeting were wondering.
The women knew better than to bring their thoughts to their faces.
None of the women sought to catch another's eye.
The men-folk looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front.
Hendry Munn did not march to the pulpit with the big Bible in his hands.
Hendry Munn came as far as the plate and signed to Peter Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry.
Every woman at the meeting, except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh.
Peter Tosh was taken aback by Hendry Munn's action.
Peter Tosh merely gaped at Hendry Munn.
Peter Tosh suddenly knew that his five daughters were furious with him.
Peter Tosh dived for his hat and staggered to the vestry with his mouth open.
Peter Tosh's boots made a cheeping sound all the way to the vestry.
No one looked up when Peter Tosh left.

An atoll is sometimes called a coral atoll.
An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef.
An atoll includes a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely.
There may be coral islands or cays on the rim of the atoll.
The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano.
The extinct seamount or volcano has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water.
The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera.
The higher rim of the atoll remains above water or at shallow depths.
The shallow depths permit the coral to grow and form the reefs.
For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must occur.
The rate of erosion or subsidence must be slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards.
The word 'atoll' comes from the Dhivehi word 'atholhu'.
Dhivehi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands.
The word 'atholhu' means an administrative subdivision.
The first recorded use of the word 'atoll' in English was in 1625 as 'atollon'.

Charles Darwin coined the definition of atolls in his work 'The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs'.
Charles Darwin defined atolls as 'circular groups of coral islets'.
The definition of atolls is synonymous with 'lagoon-island'.
More modern definitions of 'atoll' describe them as 'annular reefs enclosing a lagoon'.
In modern definitions, atolls are described as having no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus.
In an exclusively morphological sense, atolls are described as 'a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon'.

The Supreme Court has agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas.
Abigail Fisher is a white woman.
Abigail Fisher argues that she has been a victim of the University of Texas's race-conscious admission policies.
The University of Texas contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching.
The University of Texas believes that racial and ethnic diversity is a benefit to all students.
The ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies is unlikely to disappear.

The issue of racially preferential policies arrived in the early 1970s.
The issue of racially preferential policies has survived despite many attacks.
Some attacks on the issue of racially preferential policies have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions.
The Supreme Court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments.
Elena Kagan has bowed out of participation in the case.

The differences in SAT scores among racial groups are heartbreaking.
The numbers mean that underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system.
Arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage means that underperforming minority students do not catch up.

Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time.
Climate is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time.
Climate differs from weather.
Weather only describes the short-term conditions of meteorological variables in a given region.
A region's climate is generated by the climate system.
The climate system has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.
The climate of a location is affected by its latitude.
The climate of a location is affected by its terrain.
The climate of a location is affected by its altitude.
The climate of a location is affected by nearby water bodies.
The climate of a location is affected by the currents of nearby water bodies.
Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables.
The most commonly classified variables are temperature and precipitation.
The most commonly used classification scheme is the Köppen climate classification.
The Thornthwaite system has been in use since 1948.
The Thornthwaite system incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information.
The Thornthwaite system is used in studying biological diversity.
The Thornthwaite system is used in studying how climate change affects biological diversity.
The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses.
The origin of air masses defines the climate of a region.
Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates.
Direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century.
Paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables.
Proxy variables include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds.
Proxy variables include ice cores.

A gene is a locus of DNA that encodes a functional RNA or protein product.
A gene is the molecular unit of heredity.
The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits.
Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes.
Polygenes are many different genes.
Biological traits are also influenced by gene–environment interactions.
Some genetic traits are instantly visible.
Examples of instantly visible genetic traits include eye colour and number of limbs.
Some genetic traits are not instantly visible.
Examples of not instantly visible genetic traits include blood type and risk for specific diseases.
Thousands of basic biochemical processes comprise life.
Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence.
Mutations in genes lead to different variants known as alleles in the population.
Alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein.
Different versions of a protein cause different phenotype traits.
Colloquial usage of the term 'having a gene' typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.
Examples of colloquial usage include 'good genes' and 'hair colour gene'.
Genes evolve due to natural selection.
Natural selection is also known as survival of the fittest of the alleles.

A ruling in favor of George Zimmerman would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed.

Max Weber argued that 'class' is determined by economic position.

Most people know precious gemstones by their appearances.
An emerald flashes deep green.
A ruby seems to hold a red fire inside.
A diamond shines like a star.
It is more difficult to tell where a gemstone was mined.
A diamond from Australia may appear the same as a diamond from Arkansas.
A diamond from Australia may appear the same as a diamond from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin.
Beneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules, lie clues to its origin.
At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues.
Catherine McManus reported on a technique that identifies a stone's homeland.
Catherine McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics.
Materialytics is located in Killeen, Texas.
Materialytics is developing the technique.
Catherine McManus told Science News that with enough data, they could identify which country a gemstone comes from.

Some gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries.
Sales of blood minerals may encourage violent civil wars.
Violent civil wars may result in innocent people being injured or killed.
In July 2010, the U.S. government passed a law that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones.
To figure out where gemstones come from, Catherine McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone.
The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy.
Energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone.
The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma.
Plasma is a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms.
The plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern.
The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.
Different elements produce different light patterns.
Catherine McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar light patterns.
Materialytics has already collected light patterns from thousands of gemstones.
Materialytics has collected more than 200 light patterns from diamonds.
Catherine McManus and her team can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know.
Catherine McManus and her team look for a match between the light patterns.
The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone.
In a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds.
For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones.
The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples before the tool is ready for commercial use.
The scientists need to collect and analyze samples from war-torn countries before the tool is ready for commercial use.
Scientists like Barbara Dutrow find the technique exciting.
Barbara Dutrow is a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.
Barbara Dutrow told Science News that this is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality.

Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom are administered by the UK government's Office of Communications.
The UK government's Office of Communications is known as Ofcom.
Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan.
The telephone numbering plan is known as the 'National Telephone Numbering Plan'.
The National Telephone Numbering Plan is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations.
Since 28 April 2001, almost all geographic numbers have 9 or 10 national significant numbers after the '0' trunk code.
Since 28 April 2001, most non-geographic numbers have 9 or 10 national significant numbers after the '0' trunk code.
All mobile telephone numbers have 10 national significant numbers after the '0' trunk code.
The overall structure of the UK's National Numbering Plan includes a short sample of geographic numbers.
The short sample of geographic numbers is set out in the officially approved number groups by Ofcom.
In the United Kingdom, area codes are two, three, four, or rarely five digits long after the initial zero.
Regions with shorter area codes typically include large cities.
Regions with shorter area codes permit the allocation of more telephone numbers.
The local number portion has more digits in regions with shorter area codes.
Local customer numbers are four to eight figures long.
The total number of digits in a telephone number is ten.
In a very few areas, the total number of digits may be nine digits after the initial zero.
The 'area code' is also referred to as an 'STD (code)' in the UK.

Ford and little Tita broke the lucky groat together before they parted.
Little Tita wore Ford's ring upon her finger.
Little Tita said to Ford, 'Caro mio, I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my danger.'
Ford claimed that as God is his help, he saw little Tita standing before him.
Little Tita's face was in tears.
Little Tita's hands were out as though in warning.
Ford saw little Tita even as he saw Aylward and Hordle John upon their couches.
Ford felt that their very finger-tips seemed to meet.
Little Tita thinned away like a mist in the sunshine.

The last thoughts of a serial killer were found on blood-soaked, handwritten and often poetic notes in his Alaska jail cell after Israel Keyes took his own life.

Plymouth is a city on the south coast of Devon, England.
Plymouth is located about 37 miles (60 km) south-west of Exeter.
Plymouth is located 190 miles (310 km) west-south-west of London.
Plymouth is situated between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west.
The rivers Plym and Tamar join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall.
Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age.
A first settlement emerged at Mount Batten during the Bronze Age.
The settlement at Mount Batten continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire.
The settlement at Mount Batten was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton.
The village of Sutton is now called Plymouth.
In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World.
The Pilgrim Fathers established Plymouth Colony.
Plymouth Colony was the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America.
During the English Civil War, the town of Plymouth was held by the Parliamentarians.
The town of Plymouth was besieged between 1642 and 1646.
Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port.
Plymouth handled imports and passengers from the Americas.
Plymouth exported local minerals such as tin, copper, lime, china clay, and arsenic.
The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town.
In 1914, three neighbouring independent towns were merged to form a single County Borough.
The three neighbouring independent towns were the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse.
The combined town took the name of Plymouth.
Plymouth achieved city status in 1928.
The city's naval importance later led to its targeting during World War II.
The targeting of Plymouth during World War II resulted in partial destruction, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz.
After World War II, the city centre of Plymouth was completely rebuilt.
Subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.

Bob and Shelly looked around.
There were rocks, but the rocks were too hard.
There could get mud out of the pond, but the mud would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat.

Last week, things went south.
Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert.

The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment.
The show segment mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name.
The tweet stated, 'I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.'
Race meets satire in the tweet.
The controversial tweet was not written by Stephen Colbert himself.
The controversial tweet was not written by anyone on Stephen Colbert's show.

Some have been demanding that 'The Colbert Report' be canceled.
Asian-American activist Suey Park is leading the demand to cancel 'The Colbert Report'.
The words used in the tweet perpetuate hateful stereotypes.
The words bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame.
To use the words now is to call forth that history.

A fish that lives in America can live out of water for months at a time.
The ability of the fish to live out of water is similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago.
A new study shows the fish's ability to live out of water.
The Mangrove Rivulus is a kind of little fish.
The Mangrove Rivulus lives in small pools of water.
When the living place of the Mangrove Rivulus dries up, the Mangrove Rivulus lives on the land.
Scott Taylor is a researcher in Florida.
Scott Taylor stated that the fish can grow as large as three inches.
The Mangrove Rivulus groups together and breathes air through their skin before they can find water again.
The new scientific discovery came during a trip.
Scott Taylor stated that he was travelling for fun.
Scott Taylor stated that one day he kicked over a log and the fish came out.
Scott Taylor told reporters by telephone.
Scott Taylor stated that he would make his study on the Mangrove Rivulus known to the public in an American magazine early next year.
In lab tests, Scott Taylor found that the Mangrove Rivulus can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.
Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time.
The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time.
Lungfish found in Australia, Africa, and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way.
No other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active.
Patricia Wright is a biologist at a Canadian University.
Patricia Wright stated that more studies of the Mangrove Rivulus may tell how animals changed over time.
Patricia Wright stated that the conditions in which the Mangrove Rivulus lives are similar to those millions of years ago.
Patricia Wright stated that those conditions were when animals began to move from water onto land.
A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system.
Letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life.
The study involved laboratory mice.
The study found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma, and other autoimmune disorders.
There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs.
Richard Blumberg led the study.
Richard Blumberg is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.
In 1989, medical researchers sought to explain autoimmune diseases.
Medical researchers first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems.
Dr. Blumberg and his team have the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems.
Dr. Blumberg and his team say that early exposure to germs could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases.
In the adult germ-free mice, inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells.
Killer T cells normally fight infection.
Killer T cells became overactive and targeted healthy tissue, resulting in an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis.
Dr. Blumberg says that the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction.
Dr. Blumberg says that the immune systems of the mice raised in a normal environment had been 'educated' by early exposure to germs.
Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide.
Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries.
According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescriptions from their doctors.
Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.
Rob Dunn says that the new study does not mean people should stop washing.
Rob Dunn advises to wash hands, but not with antibacterial soap.
Rob Dunn suggests letting children play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside to be exposed to a diversity of things.

Linda Henkel is a scientist at Fairfield University in the US.
Linda Henkel remembers an experience at the Grand Canyon years ago.
Someone came up to the Grand Canyon's edge.
The person took a shot with their camera.
The person then walked away, feeling like they had completed the task.
The person barely glanced at the magnificent scene sprawling in front of them.
Linda Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days.
People take pictures before dinner.
People take pictures during friends' birthday parties.
People take pictures on museum tours.
People believe that taking pictures helps record the moment.
Linda Henkel's latest study found that this obsession may prevent people's brains from remembering what actually happened.
The Guardian reported on Linda Henkel's study.
In her study, Linda Henkel led a group of college students around a museum.
Linda Henkel asked the college students to simply observe 15 objects.
Linda Henkel also asked the college students to photograph 15 other objects.
The next day, the students' memory of the tour was tested.
The results showed that the students were less accurate in recognizing the objects they photographed.
The students remembered fewer details about the objects they photographed.
When people rely on technology to remember for them, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences.
Linda Henkel explained that counting on the camera to record the event means people do not need to attend to it fully themselves.
There is an exception to the negative effect of photographing objects.
If students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved.
Students who focused the lens on a specific area could recall parts that weren't in the frame.
The study suggests that constantly taking pictures can harm memory.
Reviewing pictures taken should help wake up memories.
This is true only if people spend enough time reviewing the pictures.
Linda Henkel stated that in order to remember, people have to access and interact with the photos.
Most people never take the time to look over their digital pictures.
The reason most people do not review their digital pictures is that there are too many of them.
Digital pictures are usually not very organized on people's computers.

President Barack Obama has nominated John Brennan to be the next director of the CIA.
John Brennan was Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser.
There is an emerging Obama doctrine to deal with the threat from al Qaeda and its allies.
The emerging Obama doctrine is a rejection of the use of conventional military forces.
The emerging Obama doctrine shows a growing reliance on the use of drones.
The emerging Obama doctrine shows a growing reliance on U.S. Special Operations Forces.
John Brennan has been central to Barack Obama's policy regarding counterterrorism.
In an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, John Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy.
John Brennan's speech provided more detail about the drone policy than any administration official had done publicly before.
John Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks.
John Brennan stated that there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for military purposes.
John Brennan stated that there is nothing in international law that prohibits the use of lethal force against enemies outside of an active battlefield.
John Brennan's statement includes the condition that the country involved must consent or be unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.
Ben Emmerson is the U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights.
Ben Emmerson announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks.
Ben Emmerson's investigation will examine the extent to which U.S. drone attacks cause civilian casualties.
The reaction to John Brennan's nomination has been muted compared to the reaction to Chuck Hagel.
One of John Brennan's most significant legacies is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies.
The U.S. drone campaign has targeted countries such as Pakistan and Yemen.
The focus of the U.S. drone campaign has shifted significantly in the past year or so.

In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism.
The genome consists of DNA or RNA in RNA viruses.
The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA or RNA.
The term genome was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler.
Hans Winkler was a professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany.
The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name genome to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome.
A few related -ome words already existed, such as biome and rhizome.
The words biome and rhizome form a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically.
Some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes.
The terms diploid, triploid, and tetraploid refer to organisms with multiple copies of chromosomes.
In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism, the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell.
The genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell.
The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria and archaea, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA or RNA constitute the genome.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles that contain their own DNA.
Viruses similarly contain genes.
The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA.
The term nuclear genome refers to what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA.
The term genome can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA.
The term mitochondrial genome refers to what is stored within mitochondria.

As the narrator drove along, the narrator's spirits went up again.
The narrator turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which the narrator was entering.

Mrs. Bloomfield led the narrator into the dining-room.
Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before the narrator.
While the narrator dined upon the beefsteaks and potatoes, Mrs. Bloomfield sat opposite, watching the narrator.
Mrs. Bloomfield tried to keep something like a conversation, consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks.
The narrator's attention was almost wholly absorbed in their dinner.
The narrator's attention was not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks and the numbness of their hands.
Mrs. Bloomfield stated that she had had so little time to attend to the education of the children herself.
Mrs. Bloomfield thought the children were clever and very willing to learn, especially the little boy.
Mrs. Bloomfield described the little boy as the flower of the flock.

Mrs. Bloomfield wished Mary Ann to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible.

Mrs. Bloomfield asked the narrator to look after Mary Ann's washing and dressing and take charge of her clothes.

Lublin Voivodeship was created out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska, and partially Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships.
The creation of Lublin Voivodeship was pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.
Lublin Voivodeship is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin.
The territory of Lublin Voivodeship is made of four historical lands.
The western part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Lesser Poland.
The eastern part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Red Ruthenia.
The northeast part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Polesie and Podlasie.

Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history.
The region was one of the world's leading centres of Judaism before World War II.
Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area.
The few Jews in the area were concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm.
The founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services.
The new towns competed with the existing towns for business.
There followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment due to competition.
There were failed attempts to limit Jewish immigration into the region.
The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns.
Only individual Jewish families set up businesses in the rural regions.
The urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors.
By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów, and Łęczna.
