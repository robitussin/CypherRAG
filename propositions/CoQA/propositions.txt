It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Frank's Dad.
Frank's Dad had a big family to feed.
They found Frank's Dad's boat adrift with its nets half in and half out.

People love Stephen Colbert or hate Stephen Colbert.
Not everyone gets a joke told by Stephen Colbert.
Stephen Colbert does say, in persona, amazingly offensive things sometimes.
Last week, things went south.
Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert.
The offense was a 140-character long foot-in-the-mouth that came from the Twitter feed @ColbertReport.
The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment.
The show segment mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name.
The tweet stated, 'I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.'
Race meets satire in the tweet.
The controversial tweet was not written by Stephen Colbert himself.
The controversial tweet was not written by anyone on Stephen Colbert's show.
The controversial tweet was written by a Comedy Central account.

Instead of repudiating the tweet, Stephen Colbert made further jokes about the incident on Monday night.
Stephen Colbert joked about how the incident almost silenced his message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement.
Some have been demanding that 'The Colbert Report' be canceled.
Asian-American activist Suey Park is leading the demand to cancel 'The Colbert Report'.
The words used in the tweet perpetuate hateful stereotypes.
The words bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame.
To use the words now is to call forth that history.
In calling forth that history, the words create more racism.

A fish that lives in America can live out of water for months at a time.
The ability of the fish to live out of water is similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago.
A new study shows the fish's ability to live out of water.
The Mangrove Rivulus is a kind of little fish.
The Mangrove Rivulus lives in small pools of water.
When the living place of the Mangrove Rivulus dries up, the Mangrove Rivulus lives on the land.
Scott Taylor is a researcher in Florida.
Scott Taylor stated that the fish can grow as large as three inches.
The Mangrove Rivulus groups together and breathes air through their skin before they can find water again.
The new scientific discovery came during a trip.
Scott Taylor stated that he was travelling for fun.
Scott Taylor stated that one day he kicked over a log and the fish came out.
Scott Taylor told reporters by telephone.
Scott Taylor stated that he would make his study on the Mangrove Rivulus known to the public in an American magazine early next year.
In lab tests, Scott Taylor found that the Mangrove Rivulus can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.
Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time.
The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time.
Lungfish found in Australia, Africa, and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way.
No other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active.
Patricia Wright is a biologist at a Canadian University.
Patricia Wright stated that more studies of the Mangrove Rivulus may tell how animals changed over time.
Patricia Wright stated that the conditions in which the Mangrove Rivulus lives are similar to those millions of years ago.
Patricia Wright stated that those conditions were when animals began to move from water onto land.
A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system.
Letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life.
The study involved laboratory mice.
The study found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma, and other autoimmune disorders.
There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs.
Richard Blumberg led the study.
Richard Blumberg is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.
In 1989, medical researchers sought to explain autoimmune diseases.
Medical researchers first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems.
Dr. Blumberg and his team have the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems.
Dr. Blumberg and his team say that early exposure to germs could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases.
In the adult germ-free mice, inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells.
Killer T cells normally fight infection.
Killer T cells became overactive and targeted healthy tissue, resulting in an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis.
Dr. Blumberg says that the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction.

Linda Henkel is a scientist at Fairfield University in the US.
Linda Henkel remembers an experience at the Grand Canyon years ago.
Someone came up to the Grand Canyon's edge.
The person took a shot with their camera.
The person then walked away, feeling like they had completed the task.
The person barely glanced at the magnificent scene sprawling in front of them.
Linda Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days.
People take pictures before dinner.
People take pictures during friends' birthday parties.
People take pictures on museum tours.
People believe that taking pictures helps record the moment.
Linda Henkel's latest study found that this obsession may prevent people's brains from remembering what actually happened.
The Guardian reported on Linda Henkel's study.
In her study, Linda Henkel led a group of college students around a museum.
Linda Henkel asked the college students to simply observe 15 objects.
Linda Henkel also asked the college students to photograph 15 other objects.
The next day, the students' memory of the tour was tested.
The results showed that the students were less accurate in recognizing the objects they photographed.
The students remembered fewer details about the objects they photographed.
When people rely on technology to remember for them, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences.
Linda Henkel explained that counting on the camera to record the event means people do not need to attend to it fully themselves.
There is an exception to the negative effect of photographing objects.
If students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved.
Students who focused the lens on a specific area could recall parts that weren't in the frame.
The study suggests that constantly taking pictures can harm memory.
Reviewing pictures taken should help wake up memories.
This is true only if people spend enough time reviewing the pictures.
Linda Henkel stated that in order to remember, people have to access and interact with the photos.
Most people never take the time to look over their digital pictures.
The reason most people do not review their digital pictures is that there are too many of them.
Digital pictures are usually not very organized on people's computers.

President Barack Obama has nominated John Brennan to be the next director of the CIA.
John Brennan was Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser.
There is an emerging Obama doctrine to deal with the threat from al Qaeda and its allies.
The emerging Obama doctrine is a rejection of the use of conventional military forces.
The emerging Obama doctrine shows a growing reliance on the use of drones.
The emerging Obama doctrine shows a growing reliance on U.S. Special Operations Forces.
John Brennan has been central to Barack Obama's policy regarding counterterrorism.
In an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, John Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy.
John Brennan's speech provided more detail about the drone policy than any administration official had done publicly before.
John Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks.
John Brennan stated that there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for military purposes.
John Brennan stated that there is nothing in international law that prohibits the use of lethal force against enemies outside of an active battlefield.
John Brennan's statement includes the condition that the country involved must consent or be unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.
Ben Emmerson is the U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights.
Ben Emmerson announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks.
Ben Emmerson's investigation will examine the extent to which U.S. drone attacks cause civilian casualties.
The reaction to John Brennan's nomination has been muted compared to the reaction to Chuck Hagel.
One of John Brennan's most significant legacies is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies.
The U.S. drone campaign has targeted countries such as Pakistan and Yemen.
The focus of the U.S. drone campaign has shifted significantly in the past year or so.

In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism.
The genome consists of DNA or RNA in RNA viruses.
The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA or RNA.
The term genome was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler.
Hans Winkler was a professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany.
The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name genome to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome.
A few related -ome words already existed, such as biome and rhizome.
The words biome and rhizome form a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically.
Some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes.
The terms diploid, triploid, and tetraploid refer to organisms with multiple copies of chromosomes.
In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism, the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell.
The genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell.
The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria and archaea, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA or RNA constitute the genome.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles that contain their own DNA.
Viruses similarly contain genes.
The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA.
The term nuclear genome refers to what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA.
The term genome can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA.

As the narrator drove along, the narrator's spirits went up again.
The narrator turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which the narrator was entering.
It was not far past the middle of September.
The heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold.
The journey seemed a very long one.
It was nearly one o'clock before the narrator and the companions reached the place of their destination.

The narrator wished the destination were a mile or two farther off.
For the first time in the narrator's life, the narrator must stand alone.
There was no retreating now for the narrator.

Mrs. Bloomfield left the narrator in the bedroom to take a little refreshment for a little while.
Mrs. Bloomfield led the narrator into the dining-room.
Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before the narrator.
While the narrator dined upon the beefsteaks and potatoes, Mrs. Bloomfield sat opposite, watching the narrator.
Mrs. Bloomfield tried to keep something like a conversation, consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks.
The narrator's attention was almost wholly absorbed in their dinner.
The narrator's attention was not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks and the numbness of their hands.
Mrs. Bloomfield stated that she had had so little time to attend to the education of the children herself.
Mrs. Bloomfield thought the children were clever and very willing to learn, especially the little boy.
Mrs. Bloomfield described the little boy as the flower of the flock.
Mrs. Bloomfield described the little boy as a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth.
Mrs. Bloomfield stated that her daughter Mary Ann would require watching.
Mrs. Bloomfield described Mary Ann as a very good girl on the whole.
Mrs. Bloomfield wished Mary Ann to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible.
Mary Ann was now almost six years old.
Mrs. Bloomfield believed Mary Ann might acquire bad habits from the nurses.
Mrs. Bloomfield ordered Mary Ann's bed to be placed in the narrator's room.
Mrs. Bloomfield asked the narrator to look after Mary Ann's washing and dressing and take charge of her clothes.
Mrs. Bloomfield stated that Mary Ann needed to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid.
The narrator replied they were quite willing to do so.
At that moment, the children entered the room.
Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven.
Mary was a tall girl for her age of six and somewhat dark like her mother.
The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl looking younger than Mary.
The remaining child was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two.

Lublin Voivodeship was created out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska, and partially Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships.
The creation of Lublin Voivodeship was pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.
Lublin Voivodeship is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin.
The territory of Lublin Voivodeship is made of four historical lands.
The western part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Lesser Poland.
The eastern part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Red Ruthenia.
The northeast part of Lublin Voivodeship belongs to Polesie and Podlasie.

Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history.
The region was one of the world's leading centres of Judaism before World War II.
Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area.
The few Jews in the area were concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm.
The founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services.
The new towns competed with the existing towns for business.
There followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment due to competition.
There were failed attempts to limit Jewish immigration into the region.
The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns.
Only individual Jewish families set up businesses in the rural regions.
The urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors.
By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów, and Łęczna.
