Once upon a time, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton.
Cotton lived in a barn near a farm house.
Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn.
The place above the barn was where all of the farmer's horses slept.
Cotton was not alone in her little home above the barn.
Cotton shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters.
All of Cotton's sisters were cute and fluffy.
Cotton was the only white kitten in the bunch.
The rest of Cotton's sisters were all orange.
The rest of Cotton's sisters had beautiful white tiger stripes.
Cotton's mommy had beautiful white tiger stripes.
Being different made Cotton quite sad.
Cotton often wished she looked like the rest of her family.
One day, Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint.
Cotton used the orange paint to paint herself like her sisters.
When Cotton's mommy and sisters found her, they started laughing.
Cotton's sisters asked her what she was doing.
Cotton expressed that she only wanted to be more like her sisters.
Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's face.
Cotton's mommy told Cotton that her fur was pretty and special.
Cotton's mommy said they would never want Cotton to be any other way.
Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water.
When Cotton came out of the water, she was herself again.
Cotton's sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all dry.
Cotton's sisters cried out to her not to ever do that again.
Cotton's sisters warned her that next time she might mess up her pretty white fur.
Cotton thought that she changed her mind.
Cotton realized that she liked being special.
